## Build

This project is ready to be built on [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). The `CMakeLists.txt` file is already configured to build the
project. SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer libraries are included. No additional setup is required.

To build the project, clone this repo and open in JetBrains CLion, Invalidate CMake Caches and Restart, then reload
CMake Project. After that,
build the project.

#### Requirement to build without CLion:

- **CMake** 3.29.3 or higher
- **SDL2**, **SDL2_image**, **SDL2_ttf**, **SDL2_mixer** (Already included in SDL folder)
- **MinGW** (for gcc.exe, g++.exe)
- **Ninja** (ninja.exe)

**Build command**:

Open the cloned game source folder and run this command in terminal:
```shell
cmake -S . -G Ninja -B build "-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/PATHTO/g++.exe" "-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/PATHTO/gcc.exe" "-DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=/PATHTO/ninja.exe"
cmake --build ./build --target FHI_Flower_Harvesting_Inc -j 14
```
Replace `/PATHTO/` with the path to the compiler and build tools.
